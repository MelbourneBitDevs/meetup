## Add topics to discuss this month!

Please suggest any noteworthy topics for next month in the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MelbourneBitDevs/MelbBitDevs/issues)! We're open to discussing pretty much anything Bitcoin, news, free software, tech, privacy, or related!

# MelbBitdevs - When and Where

As a group, we discuss the latest Bitcoin news from a technical perspective. Sometimes we diverge into adjacent fields of privacy, self hosting, free software, and more!

Privacy of attendees is respected, no photos/recordings.
